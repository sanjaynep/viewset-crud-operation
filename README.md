# Viewset CRUD Operation

This project demonstrates how to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Django REST Framework using the `ModelViewSet` class.

## Features

- **ModelViewSet-based CRUD**: All CRUD functionality is managed through a single class, leveraging DRF's powerful `ModelViewSet`.
- **RESTful API**: Exposes endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete model instances.
- **Serializer Integration**: Uses DRF serializers for input validation and output formatting.
- **Easy Routing**: Utilizes DRF routers to automatically generate URL patterns for the API.
