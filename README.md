# Viewset CRUD Operation

This project demonstrates how to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Django REST Framework using the `ModelViewSet` class.

## Features

- **ModelViewSet-based CRUD**: All CRUD functionality is managed through a single class, leveraging DRF's powerful `ModelViewSet`.
- **RESTful API**: Exposes endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete model instances.
- **Serializer Integration**: Uses DRF serializers for input validation and output formatting.
- **Easy Routing**: Utilizes DRF routers to automatically generate URL patterns for the API.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanjaynep/viewset-crud-operation.git
   cd viewset-crud-operation
IT is based on the abstraction using modelviewset classes that are already demontrated

To run server run python manage.py runserver
